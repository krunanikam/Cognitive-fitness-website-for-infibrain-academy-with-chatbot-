            <h2>Neuro Meditation</h2>
            <p>Neuro meditation, also known as neurofeedback meditation, is a type of meditation that combines traditional meditation practices with modern technology. It often involves the use of EEG (electroencephalography) sensors to monitor brainwave activity, providing real-time feedback to the practitioner. This feedback can help the practitioner learn to regulate their brainwaves more effectively, potentially leading to deeper meditative states, improved focus, and reduced stress.</p>
